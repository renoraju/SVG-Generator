# SVG-Generator

## Description

This is an app that is supposed to create an SVG based on user preference

## Installation/URL
Video demonstration how the SVG generator app works. However I did run into an error as demonstrated in video. The node modules weren't found and I couldnt fix that 
error. I tried to research the issue through stack overflow, deleted the modules and reinstalled them multiple time but the same issue occured. The dependencies are 
present in the node modules. I changed the script as well to Jest and downloaded the inquirer program however, I still ran into that issue. I did complete most of the code
and I believe that it works well if it wasnt for the issue with node modules so I decided to submit what I have.
